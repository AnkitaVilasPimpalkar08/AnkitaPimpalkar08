Professional Summary

I am a Computer Science graduate student at George Washington University with strong hands-on experience in full-stack software engineering, real-time data systems, and applied machine learning.

My work focuses on building end-to-end systems — from data ingestion and backend APIs to machine learning models and user-facing dashboards. I enjoy working on technically complex problems where data quality, system reliability, and model interpretability matter as much as performance.

I have professional experience across:
	•	Academic research environments
	•	Early-stage startups
	•	Enterprise IT systems (Cognizant)

This gives me a strong perspective on how systems evolve from prototypes to production-grade platforms.
