👋 About Me

I’m a Computer Science graduate student at George Washington University with hands-on experience building full-stack systems, real-time data pipelines, and applied machine learning solutions.

My work sits at the intersection of:
	•	Software Engineering (production systems, APIs, dashboards)
	•	Data Engineering (ETL, real-time processing, databases)
	•	Machine Learning (anomaly detection, deep learning, interpretability)

I enjoy working on problems where data meets real users — especially systems that need to be reliable, interpretable, and scalable.
